OVERVIEW

Project that simulates a decision tree to help the customer check house prices in a certain region, the customer must respond some questions with yes or no, and then the chatbot will return wether the price is cheap, average, or expensive. The answer given to the customer is based on a decision tree based on a database from house prices, in which the classification method consists in finding the GINI Index that measures the impurity of picking a random sample, the coefficient varies between 0 and 1, in which 0 represents purity and 1 impurity.
